<p>When you&rsquo;re a relatively new developer, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in all of the things that you don&rsquo;t know. And boy is <em>that</em> a long, long list of things. But there&rsquo;s also another list that we should probably consider and revisit from time to time: the list of all the things we thought we knew, but didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> understand when we learned them.</p>

<p>Last week, while developing some curriculum for an Intro to Programming course, my co-teacher and I had one of those moments. We were trying to draw a diagram to explain the concept of an object &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; a method. As I looked back through our code snippets, I noticed that we were using very basic methods like <code>puts</code> and <code>gets</code> quite often, as most Ruby tutorials usually do. And then I realized something: I had no clue what the receiver of the <code>puts</code> method was.</p>

<p>We both just sat there, partly perplexed and partly dumbfounded. How could we not know how <code>puts</code> and <code>gets</code> really worked? We used them all the time when we were learning to code, so perhaps we didn&rsquo;t really think past the flexibility of these methods. But now that we are both more seasoned programmers, it seemed strange that we had never really thought about this before.</p>

<p>So, I did exactly what any good developer would do: I asked Twitter. Well, okay, I asked Twitter&hellip;and then I put on my detective hat and did some investigating of my own.</p>

<h2>Puts, I love you, but you&rsquo;re bringing me down</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RUBYISTS, please help: what is the receiver of the puts and gets methods? Is it the main Object? I need to know, it&#39;s driving me crazy</p>&mdash; Vaidehi Joshi (@vaidehijoshi) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi/status/596465002669875201">May 8, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I have a bone to pick with the <code>puts</code> method. Well, okay, two bones I guess. First, it has no explicit receiver:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>♥ irb
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :001 &gt; puts "wat"
</span><span class='line'>wat
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; nil </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And second, it&rsquo;s just REALLY hard to figure out what on earth is happening with this method. In fact, the hardest part about understanding <code>puts</code> was figuring out exactly <em>where</em> inside of Ruby it lived.</p>

<p>Apparently though, there&rsquo;s a method for that &ndash; well, two methods, actually. The <code>owner</code> and the <code>receiver</code> methods can be used to ask a method where it lives and who it can be called on. We can just pass it the name of the method we&rsquo;re curious about as a symbol, and then ask it where it belongs:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.0 :002 &gt; method(:puts).receiver
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; main 
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :003 &gt; method(:puts).owner
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; Kernel </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>WAT. It seemed like <code>main</code> was the receiver of this method, while <code>Kernel</code> was the owner, or the place where this method was actually defined.</p>

<p>But did that mean that <code>main</code> was also self within the context of <code>irb</code>? And what <em>was</em> <code>main</code>, exactly? There was only one way to find out:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.0 :004 &gt; method(:gets).receiver == self
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; true 
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :005 &gt; self
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; main 
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :006 &gt; self.class
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; Object</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Pretty weird, right? But hang on&hellip;there was a line up there that was pretty new for me. Something about a <code>Kernel</code>? Let&rsquo;s do a bit more detective work.</p>

<h2>Tell Me &lsquo;Bout Them Kernels</h2>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/rambtrormFyWQ" width="480" height="268" frameBorder="0" style="max-width: 100%" class="giphy-embed" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re probably wondering: <em>So that <code>Kernel</code> thing &ndash; what&rsquo;s the deal?</em> Well, it turns out that <code>Kernel</code> is a module, and if you&rsquo;re like me, you probably haven&rsquo;t thought about it that much until now.</p>

<p>But what you might remember about modules is that they have to be mixed into a class in order to be included; that is to say, in order for a class or instances of a class to have access to methods in a module, that module has to be included or extended into the class.</p>

<p>Which means that <code>Kernel</code> has to be included into a Ruby class. But&hellip;which one? To figure out, we need to think back to what <code>self</code> was within the context of <code>irb</code>: <code>main</code>. If we try to ask <code>main</code> for its ancestors (so that we can deduce where the <code>Kernel</code> module is coming into play), we get this error:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.0 :007 &gt; main.ancestors
</span><span class='line'>NoMethodError: undefined method `ancestors' for main:Object
</span><span class='line'>  from (irb):75
</span><span class='line'>  from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Okay, not so great. But hang on a second&hellip;since we know that <code>main</code> is an instance of the <code>Object</code> class, we can just ask the <code>Object</code> class who its ancestors are!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.0 :008 &gt; Object.ancestors
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; [Object, Kernel, BasicObject] </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Nice! We found <code>Kernel</code>, and it looks like it&rsquo;s included the <code>Object</code> class. We can figure this out because it appears to the right of <code>Object</code>, which means it has been mixed into the class to its left.</p>

<p>So, if a method like <code>puts</code> is written in the <code>Kernel</code> module, what can it be called on? Who is doing the &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; of this method call? Well, according to <a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_m_kernel.html">the Ruby docs</a>, pretty much anything:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Kernel module is included by class Object, so its methods are available in every Ruby object. These methods are called without a receiver and thus can be called in functional form.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, theoretically-speaking, if the Kernel module is included by class Object, and is therefore available to <em>every</em> Ruby object, we should be able to call <code>puts</code> on a <code>String</code> instance, right?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.0 :009 &gt; "".puts('wat')
</span><span class='line'>NoMethodError: private method `puts' called for "":String
</span><span class='line'>  from (irb):79
</span><span class='line'>  from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Uh oh! Maybe we can&rsquo;t. But&hellip;why not?</p>

<h2>Global Functions</h2>

<p>If you are smart cookie, you probably read that error and guessed that <code>puts</code> is a private method defined on <code>Kernel</code>. We can confirm this by using the <code>private_method_defined?</code> method to double check:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.0 :010 &gt; Kernel.private_method_defined?(:puts)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; true</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The fact that <code>puts</code> is a private method is important. It means that it can&rsquo;t be called explicitly by anyone else. But how is it, then, that we use this method so frequently and easily? Well, because its mixed in to class <code>Object</code>, it&rsquo;s accessible to any Ruby object &ndash; but only in the current context. This explains why <code>puts</code> never has to be called explicitly upon any object; instead, it will be called <em>implicitly</em> on whatever <code>self</code> happens to be. In other words, the method will be called on the current context of <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also pretty crucial that a method like <code>puts</code> can be called in the current context of self. In fact, that&rsquo;s exactly what allows us to do this within a Ruby class:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Class</span> <span class="no">Duck</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">swim</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;We&#39;re swimming.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">quack</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Quack quack!&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or something like this in <code>irb</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="mo">011</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Waddle waddle&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Waddle</span> <span class="n">waddle</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Even though the context of <code>self</code> changes from the Duck Class, to an instance of a Duck, back to <code>main</code> in <code>irb</code>, we have access to <code>puts</code> in all contexts. It&rsquo;s kind of magical, if you think about it: a single private method, defined in a module, trickles down to all Ruby objects that descend from it!</p>

<p>And this magic has a name: <strong>global functions</strong> work. Since methods like <code>puts</code> are defined on the <code>Kernel</code> and mixed into the <code>Object</code> class, they are accessible <em>everywhere</em>. They&rsquo;re private methods, which means they must be invoked without an explicit receiver (also known as a &ldquo;function form&rdquo; of method invocation).</p>

<p>I really liked the way that <a href="https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2014/04/22/rubys-kernel-module/">this blog post</a> explains the concept:</p>

<blockquote><p>Virtually all Ruby objects inherit from Object and have access to the methods defined in the Kernel module, so Kernel’s private instance methods are accessible virtually anywhere in a Ruby program, regardless of self.</p></blockquote>

<p>And you know what&rsquo;s even cooler? These global functions defined on <code>Kernel</code> are used everywhere! In fact, you probably don&rsquo;t even realize that you use them. Here are some of the ones that surprised me:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gets</code></li>
<li><code>chomp</code></li>
<li><code>sleep</code></li>
<li><code>require</code></li>
<li><code>gem</code></li>
<li><code>rand</code></li>
<li><code>gsub</code></li>
<li><code>proc</code></li>
<li><code>eval</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Yup. All of these methods are defined on <code>Kernel</code>, available to all objects (including <code>main</code> as <code>self</code> in <code>irb</code>), and don&rsquo;t need a receiver to be called!</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/gLRDi5KnA3Fte" width="480" height="374" frameBorder="0" style="max-width: 100%" class="giphy-embed" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Now that you know where all these methods live and where they come from, you probably feel pretty powerful. You also will hopefully feel more purposeful when you write even a simple <code>puts</code> statement in a line of code.</p>

<p>Perhaps the moral of the story here is to never take code for granted: always question how it works and try to understand exactly what&rsquo;s going on in every line that you type.</p>

<p>The second moral is to use other developers on Twitter as resources to help you figure out what to Google, obvs.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>Kernel</code> module is mixed into the <code>Object</code> class, which means all methods (including private methods!) defined on this module are accesible to all Ruby objects, making them &ldquo;global&rdquo; functions.</li>
<li>Even though a method&rsquo;s implicit receiver is <code>self</code>, the context of <code>self</code> changes depending on which class you are in; this is particularly important when dealing with &ldquo;global&rdquo; functions.</li>
<li>Curious about <code>main</code> and <code>self</code> in <code>irb</code>? Check out these two great <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/rubys-top-self-object/">blog</a> <a href="https://banisterfiend.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/what-is-the-ruby-top-level/">posts</a>.</li>
